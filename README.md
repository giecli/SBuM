# SBuM
## Smart Building Model

This model was developed to assess the role of smart building in the decarbonisation process of the power system. it was built in MatLab and can be used within MatLab environment. It is possible to set up building simulation from the UI and results can also be retrieved using the same UI. 

It was developed through the Smart Energy Network 2050 financed by the Academy of Finland
